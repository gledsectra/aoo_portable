Automation with Apache Open Office Portable (for Microsoft Windows) 
- Files and Folders by PortableApps / Apache Open Office (v. 4.1.11) - https://portableapps.com/ - https://www.openoffice.org/
- VBS (test code) from https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/DevGuide/ProUNO/Bridge/Automation_Bridge
- Registry entries from https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/DevGuide/ProUNO/Bridge/The_Service_Manager_Component

How to use:
1. Save the folders of this project to your desired location;
2. Run program\\_config.bat to add required keys into Windows Registry;
3. Run the file test.vbs to test.

Notes: 
If you need change the folder location after configuration, you have to run \_config.bat again.
If you already have the Open Office installed, the steps 1 and 2 are unnecessary, and can override the original settings. 
Use it at your own risk.
